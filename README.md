# IoT Based Smart-Energy-Monitoring-System-with-Real-Time-Telegram-Alerts Using esp-32

The increasing demand for real-time electricity monitoring has driven the need for smart 
metering solutions that enhance energy efficiency and user accessibility. This project 
presents the development of an IoT-based Smart Electricity Energy Meter utilizing the 
ESP32 microcontroller and the Telegram app for remote monitoring. By incorporating 
high-precision sensors‚ÄîSCT-013 for current measurement and ZMPT101B for voltage 
detection‚Äîthe system accurately measures voltage, current, power, and total energy 
consumption in kilowatt-hours (kWh). The collected data is displayed in real-time on both 
an LCD and the Telegram app, allowing users to monitor their electricity usage remotely. 
This smart metering solution aims to improve monitoring electricity consumption, promote 
energy conservation, and facilitate data-driven decision-making for users.
